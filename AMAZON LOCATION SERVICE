<p id="b9c1">Location-based services have become an important part of many business applications as more and more businesses start offering customizing products /services based on geographical areas. Even though there are a lot of location-based services already available, however, there are a lot of concerns about security, privacy &amp; cost. It is well-known fact that some of the companies sell location-based data for advertising.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="4a7e">AWS has recently launched its own managed Amazon Location Service that will allow customers to add location data to applications, which includes capabilities such as maps, points of interest, geocoding, routing, geofences, and tracking. Amazon Location provides cost-effective location-based services (LBS) using high-quality data from global, trusted providers&nbsp;<strong>Esri&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;HERE.</strong>&nbsp;With affordable data, tracking and geofencing capabilities, and built-in metrics for health monitoring, you can build sophisticated location-enabled applications.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="5cb3">Amazon Location Service offers four types of AWS resources for your location data needs. You can create one or more of these resources using the Amazon Location console, the Amazon Location APIs, or the SDKs</p>

<ul><li>Amazon Location Service Maps enables you to select a map from a map provider to use on your mobile or web application.</li><li>Amazon Location Service Places lets you select a data provider for geocoding, reverse geocoding, and searching for points of interest.</li><li>Amazon Location Service Routes lets you find routes and estimate travel time based on the up-to-date roadway and live traffic information from your chosen data provider.</li><li>Amazon Location Service Geofences allow you to define areas of interest as a virtual boundary on a map. You can then evaluate locations against them and get notifications of entry and exit events.</li><li>Amazon Location Service Trackers receive location updates from your devices. You can link trackers to collections of geofences so that all position updates are automatically evaluated against all your geofences.</li></ul>

<p id="5d2f"><strong>User engagement and geomarketing</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="5df5">Use location data to build solutions that improve user engagement with marketing to target customers. For example, Amazon Location can trigger an event that prompts a notification when a customer who ordered a coffee on their mobile app is nearby. Additionally, you can build geomarketing features so that retailers can send discount codes or digital flyers to customers who are near target stores.</p>

<h1 id="7267">Delivery</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="ce54">Integrate location features into delivery applications to store, track, and coordinate the departure location, delivery vehicles, and their destination. For example, a food delivery application with Amazon Location features built-in has location tracking and geofencing capabilities that can automatically notify a restaurant when a delivery driver is nearby. This reduces the wait times wait time and helps maintain the quality of the food delivered.</p>
